# Crowd-Funding Using Solidity

This is one of my earliest projects where I am learning to code in solidity. This project utilizes ERC20 in crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is also known as crowd sale. In recent years, many projects have done crowdfunding using blockchain technology and received funding in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. In return, these projects give tokens to investors. However, before the Ethereum blockchain, crowdfunding was done manually, and tokens were distributed later. Also, it was not easy to do crowdfunding using cryptocurrencies. With the Ethereum blockchain and especially with the ERC20 standard, using the power of smart contracts becomes very easy for any project.
